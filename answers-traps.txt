Q1: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds
    13 in main's call to printf?
A1: a0-a7 are the argument registers
    a2 holds 13

Q2: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?
A2: 0000000000000034 calls to printf
    no call to f and g, i personally think they are optimized out

Q3: At what address is the function printf located?
A3: 000000000000064a

Q4: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A4: 000000000000064a

Q5: Run the following code.

    unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	  printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
    What is the output?
A5: HE110 World

Q6: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is
    not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

  	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A6: The value depends on what value is stored in register a2, this is because the compiler
    will place the function arguments in a0-a7, since this format of printf expects 3 arguments,
    it will print what is stored in a2
